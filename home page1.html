			<p class="card-text">The Burj Khalifa, conceived and designed as the world’s tallest building, is a mixed-use tower which blends hotel, luxury residential, and office uses. The first Armani Hotel occupies the lowest levels of the tower, while mid tower floors contain private luxury residences and corporate office spaces occupy the upper stories. The tower features the highest outdoor observatory in the world and sky lobbies with amenities for residents. Below grade levels are used for parking and service areas. Drawing on its experience as the world’s leader of tall building design and engineering, the design firm designed the tower utilizing a “Y” shaped plan to maximize the perimeter for residential and hotel uses while maintaining the efficiency of the floor plan. The “Y” shaped plan also provided a stable platform on which to base the development of a new “buttressed core” structural system specially developed to support a building of this height while maintaining the tower’s slender and elegant shape. The Burj Khalifa holds the record in all three categories as recognized by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (i.e., highest architectural top, highest occupied floor and highest tip).</p>

While it is superlative in every respect, it is the unique design of Burj Khalifa that truly sets it apart. The centrepiece 
of this new world capital attracted the world's most esteemed designers to an invited design competition.

Ultimately, the honour of designing the world's tallest tower was awarded to the global leader in creating ultra-tall 
structures, the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM) with Adrian Smith FAIA, RIBA, 
consulting design partner. The selected design was subject to an extensive peer review program to confirm the 
safety and effectiveness of the structural systems.

<img src="228.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 

	Architecture
The architecture features a triple-lobed footprint, an abstraction of the Hymenocallis flower. The tower is composed 
of three elements arranged around a central core. The modular, Y-shaped structure, with setbacks along each of its 
three wings, provides an inherently stable configuration for the structure and provides good floor plates for 
residential. Twenty-six helical levels decrease the cross-section of the tower incrementally as it spirals skyward.

The central core emerges at the top and culminates in a sculpted spire. A Y-shaped floor plan maximizes views of 
the Arabian Gulf. Viewed from the base or the air, Burj Khalifa is evocative of the onion domes prevalent in Islamic 
architecture.

<img src="230.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 
<img src="231.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 

	Wind Tunnel Testing
Over 40 wind tunnel tests were conducted on Burj Khalifa to examine the effects the wind would have on the tower 
and its occupants. These ranged from initial tests to verify the wind climate of Dubai, to large structural analysis 
models and facade pressure tests, to micro-climate analysis of the effects at terraces and around the tower base. 
Even the temporary conditions during the construction stage were tested with the tower cranes on the tower to 
ensure safety at all times.
	
Stack effect or chimney effect is a phenomenon that affects super-tall building design and arises from the changes 
in pressure and temperature with height. Special studies were carried on Burj Khalifa to determine the magnitude 
of the changes that would have to be dealt with in the building design.

<img src="232.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 

	Floor Plan
Concourse level to level 8 and level 38 and 39 will feature the Armani Hotel Dubai. Levels 9 to 16 will exclusively 
house luxurious one and two-bedroom Armani Residences.

Floors 45 through 108 are private ultra-luxury residences. The Corporate Suites occupy most of the remaining floors, 
except for level 122 which houses At.mosphere and level 124, the tower's public observatory, At the Top, Burj 
Khalifa.

For the convenience of homeowners, the tower has been divided into sections with exclusive Sky Lobbies on 
Levels 43, 76 and 123 that feature state-of-the-art fitness facilities including a Jacuzzis on Level 43 and 76. The 
Sky Lobbies on 43 and 76 additionally house swimming pools and a recreational room each that can be utilized for 
gatherings and lifestyle events — offering an unparalleled experience, both pools open to the outside offering 
residents the option of swimming from inside to the outside balcony.

Other facilities for residents include a Residents' Library, and Lafayette Gourmet, a gourmet convenience store and a 
meeting place for the residents. Valet parking is provided for guests and visitors.

<img src="233.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 

	Interiors
The interior design of Burj Khalifa public areas was also done by the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill 
LLP and was led by award-winning designer Nada Andric. It features glass, stainless steel and polished dark stones, 
together with silver travertine flooring, Venetian stucco walls, handmade rugs and stone flooring. The interiors were 
inspired by local culture while staying mindful of the building's status as a global icon and residence.

<img src="233.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 
	Artwork
Over 1,000 pieces of art from prominent Middle Eastern and international artists adorn Burj Khalifa and the 
surrounding Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard. Many of the pieces were specially commissioned by Emaar to be a 
tribute to the spirit of global harmony. The pieces were selected as a means of linking cultures and communities, 
symbolic of Burj Khalifa being an international collaboration.

<img src="235.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 

	Construction
Excavation work began for Burj Khalifa in January 2004 and over the ensuing years to its completion; the building 
passed many important milestones on its goal to become the tallest man-made structure the world has ever seen. 
In just 1,325 days since excavation work started in January 2004, Burj Khalifa became the tallest free-standing 
structure in the world.

<img src="244.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="1000";> 

	Construction Highlights
Over 45,000 m3 (58,900 cu yd) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes were used to construct the concrete 
and steel foundation, which features 192 piles buried more than 50 m (164 ft) deep. Burj Khalifa's construction 
will have used 330,000 m3 (431,600 cu yd) of concrete and 39,000 tonnes (43,000 ST; 38,000 LT) of steel rebar, 
and construction will have taken 22 million man-hours.

The exterior cladding of Burj Khalifa began in May 2007 and was completed in September 2009. The vast project 
involved more than 380 skilled engineers and on-site technicians. At the initial stage of installation, the team 
progressed at the rate of about 20 to 30 panels per day and eventually achieved as many as 175 panels per day.

The tower accomplished a world record for the highest installation of an aluminium and glass façade with a height 
of 512 metres. The total weight of aluminium used on Burj Khalifa is equivalent to that of five A380 aircrafts 
and the total length of stainless steel bull nose fins is 293 times the height of Eiffel Tower in Paris.

In November 2007, the highest reinforced concrete core walls were pumped using 80 MPa concrete from ground 
level. A vertical height of 601 metres. This smashed the previous pumping record on a building of 470m on Taipei 
101; the world’s second tallest tower and the previous world record for vertical pumping of 532 metres for an 
extension to the Riva del Garda Hydroelectric Power Plant in 1994. The concrete pressure during pumping to this 
level was nearly 200 bars.

The amount of rebar used for the tower is 31,400 metric tons - laid end to end this would extend over a quarter 
of the way around the world.

	The Burj al Arab is a luxury hotel that stands on an artificial island nearly 300 m from the Jumeirah Beach
in Dubai, UAE. Standing at 321 m, it is the third tallest hotel in the world and one of the most expensive, costing 
an estimated 7.8bn dollars. Led by the architect Tom Wright, Atkins designed a high-tech building to resemble the 
billowing sail of a traditional Arab ‘dhow’ or yacht. The building is notable for a number of complex engineering

    As it happens, Barcelona wasn’t always such a clear-cut city. In fact, to get an idea of what Barcelona 
used to look like from above, you need only to look at a map of the Gothic Quarter: a maze-like network 
of streets shooting out of one another in every direction with no regard for parallelism or perpendicularity.

    What’s more, in order to design this extension of the city—or eixample in Catalan—Cerdà set out to 
study the way residents lived in the urban space surrounding them. He paid attention to things like fresh 
air, green spaces, modes of transport and proximity to markets. Known as ‘urban planning’ today, this 
mode of thinking was revolutionary at the time and Cerdà’s proposal was ridiculed by many.

    After carefully studying the city and its residents, Cerdà proposed to build the Eixample as a strict 
grid pattern of equally sized blocks. Long, wide streets cut across the blocks in order to facilitate transport 
and navigation. Additionally, each of the blocks was made into an octagon, with chamfered corners giving 
the impression that they were ‘cut off’.

    According to Cerdà, this detail would provide greater air circulation in the streets, higher visibility 
around corners and would make it possible for trams to easily turn the corners of the blocks. The blocks 
were also all oriented in a NW-SE direction so as to ensure that each household received enough natural 
light each day.

    One of the other features of Cerdà’s pioneering design was the provision for green spaces in the centre 
of each of the blocks. These gardens were designed to provide recreational spaces for the residents and 
a place to enjoy the outdoor air away from the roads. Though, many of these interior patios have since 
been used for other constructions purposes, Cerdà’s concern for green spaces is one that is once again 
of interest to Barcelona’s local council.

    In fact, Barcelona’s city council has announced its plan to create ‘superblocks’: a group of nine existing 
blocks between which traffic will be limited in favour of pedestrianised areas and green spaces. This
will not be an insignificant move in a city were approximately 3,500 premature deaths a year are due to 
air pollution.

	Paris is a city rich in history, and a lot of it’s stories are told 
through the city’s classic architecture. For example, did you know 
that Paris was once a Roman city called Lutetia? You can still visit 
the remaining Roman ruins called the Arènes de Lutèce, hidden away 
in the historic 5th arrondissement. Want to know more fun facts about 
Paris and its incredible architecture? Read on to learn my top 5 fun

	Fun fact n°1: Paris has 37 bridges!
<img src="249.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";>

		The river Seine divides Paris into the Right Bank and the Left Bank. 
	Much like in London, Parisians are very loyal to their side of the river, and each 
	side has many different things to offer. In a city built around a river, bridges 
	are an essential aspect of the landscape, and in Paris the city’s 37 bridges double 
	as beautiful monuments!

		Parisian civilization actually began on the Ile de la Cité and the city developed 
	outwards. The first bridge in Paris connected the Ile de la Cité to the neighboring 
	island of Ile Saint-Louis. This wooden bridge was called the Petit Pont, and had to 
	be reconstructed many times through the centuries due to floods. Today, you can still 
	cross this little bridge, though now it’s been remade in stone.
		
		The first “iconic” bridge of Paris is actually the oldest one standing today. The 
	Pont Neuf, was constructed in the 16th century, and was the first of many beautiful 
	Parisian bridges. This bridge is perfect for visiting at sunset, there are even benches 
	so you can sit and enjoy the panoramic city views! During the turn of the 20th 
	century, Paris added several more gorgeous bridges. The Pont Bir-Hakeim, 
	Pont Alexandre III and Pont d’Alma are all worth a visit.


	Fun fact n°2: No skyscrapers!
<img src="250.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";>

		Since Paris exiled its business district to a Western suburb, there are no 
	skyscrapers in the city itself. Standing at 300 meters tall, the Eiffel Tower is the 
	tallest building in Paris! The only other tall building in Paris is the Montparnasse 
	Tower which is 210 meters tall. Parisians were upset when this tower was 
	constructed, and some still don’t like it. But, the Montparnasse Tower offers the 
	best view of Paris and the Eiffel Tower! Other than these two tall structures, 
	nearly all the buildings in Paris are less than 9 stories tall. Much to the dismay 
	of locals, the French government recently updated the law, to allow new buildings 
	to be up to 11 stories tall.

		These laws ensure that monuments like Notre-Dame, Sacre-Coeur and of 
	course, the Eiffel tower are still front and center on the Parisian skyline.


	Fun fact n°3: Paris is green
<img src="251.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";>

		Paris is called the city of lights, but did you also know it’s a city of green? 
	King Henri IV had more than 500,000 trees planted across the city during his reign. 
	A touch of green is the perfect compliment to the beautiful Parisian architecture. 
	Tree-lined boulevards and avenues have become an integral part of the Parisian 
	landscape. To this day, the main avenues are still lined with tall, lush trees and 
	the smaller streets have their fair share of green, too. Wondering where you can 
	see the green side of Paris? In my opinion, a stroll in the beautiful neighborhood 
	of Montmartre is one of the best ways to see green Paris.


	Fun fact n°4: Paris was transformed
<img src="252.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 
	
		In 1850, Paris was still very much a medieval city without modern 
	conveniences. Small streets and lack of public transportation made life in 
	Paris increasingly difficult during this time. One man, Baron Haussman, 
	completely remodeled the city under the reign of Napoleon III. From 1852 
	until 1870, small streets were transformed into grandiose boulevards and 
	little gardens made into parks. Not to mention, most of the gorgeous limestone 
	buildings that we see today were constructed during this time. This style of 
	architecture is called Haussmanian, named after the Baron Haussman. The 
	addition of the metro and the city’s Haussman expansion paved the way for 
	Paris to become the international city it is today.


	Fun fact n°5: There’s an underground Paris
<img src="253.jpg"; class="card1jpg"; width="700"; height="500";> 

		Did you know that there’s an entire network of tunnels just underneath 
	the streets of Paris? Known as the catacombs, these underground passageways 
	hold a lot of secrets. The official catacombs are rather spooky! These 
	underground rooms were made in the 1700’s to house the remains of over six 
	million Parisians when the city’s cemeteries started overflowing. Today, you 
	can visit the official catacombs museum, and explore all the city’s darkest 
	secrets.
	
		Aside from the museum, there is an incredible maze of tunnels underneath 
	the city, which the French Resistance used during WWII. Today, many of the 
	tunnels remain and are used for underground concerts and parties. There’s an 
	entire underground culture down there, and those who frequent the catacombs 
	often take on a secret identity and are known as cataphiles. These catacombs 
	are only accessible from man holes across the city, but their location is 
	always changing as the police find out and close them.
